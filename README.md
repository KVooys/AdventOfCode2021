# AdventOfCode2021
Advent Of Code 2021!

Adventofcode.com is an amazing online code challenge event that happens every December.
There are 25 challenges, one for every day until Christmas.

After using Python and Golang the last few years, this year I'll be doing the challenges in Kotlin which is completely unknown to me.
Should be fun! Let's get cracking.
